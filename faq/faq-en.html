<p>KICKICO is a fundraising platform for various projects including the business sphere, which allows you to launch a variety of fundraising campaigns such as: ICO, preICO, crowdfunding and crowdinvesting campaigns. At the platform&#39;s first launch stage, the funds are accepted in BTC and ETH crypto-currencies. Soon, other crypto-currencies and fiat money (USD, EUR, etc.) will be accepted. The funds are transferred to the authors in the ETH crypto currency, so author can be anywhere in the world - the platform does not have citizenship requirements except for one: the campaign should not be contrary to the jurisdiction legislation in the country author has citizenship in. Thus, the author himself can choose which country to incorporate his campaign in and pay taxes, allowing him to optimize them. The fact differentiating KICKICO from other platforms is the ability of money transfers to be proceeded from any place of the world obtaining Internet connection. In this regard, KICKICO is available to any country residents including Asian region.</p>

<p>Anyone can create a campaign and no special technical knowledge is required for this: just create a text description, create a campaign page and set its parameters. In case user needs his own crypto currency or other tokens, he can create it in the required amount directly on the platform with a simple and intuitive interface, just in few steps. Then user can create discounts and rewards system, as well as what and how much backer will receive after the purchase. The campaign can be launched by the author at any convenient time after the moderators&rsquo; approval.</p>

<p>The key feature of the platform is its own crypto currency - KickCoins. KickCoins are awarded to investors and backers financially participating in the campaigns launched on the platform. Moreover, if this is an ICO-campaign, investors participating in it receive two crypto-currencies for the same money: the campaign&#39;s crypto currency and KickCoins. If campaign is crowdfunding, the backers receive in exchange for their money not empty promises, as on other platforms, but firstly they receive KickCoins, and in addition to them, the promises of the authors. If a backer&#39;s campaign does not fulfil its promises (the game is not published, the film is not taken down, etc.), then the backers participating in it are always able to sell KickCoins on the markets, even with a profit in some cases.</p>

<p>KICKONOMY is an ecosystem formed by campaigns accepting KickCoins for payment. Anyone can become a participant: a game with purchases or even copies are sold in KickCoins; A service with a purchases ability in KickCoins; Even a cafe where you can have dinner by paying KickCoins. Authors of platform-launched campaigns that commit to accept KickCoins receive special support from the platform in the form of priority placement in the FEATURED widget, mailing lists participation and platform digests *. In addition, KICKONOMY participants will gain more loyalty from investors or backers: with each new project advent in the ecosystem, KickCoins will become more popular and demanded, which increases liquidity and, consequently, its price.</p>

<p>KICKICO is very convenient, fast and so simple that even a child could launch his campaign in ten minutes. This is the most accessible and democratic platform in the world, destroying barriers between countries and people, relieving its users of bureaucracy and restrictions imposed by obsolete, stagnant legislative systems. KICKICO is the freedom to create our present and future ourselves, right here and now.</p>

<p>ICO, or Initial Coin Offering is a mechanism for raising funds, under the terms of which future crypto currency is sold for liquid virtual money. You invest bitcoin or ether in ICO, and in return receive tokens of the new project. This is another realization of the crowdfunding model. The participants finance the company&#39;s development now in order to obtain from it some benefit in the future.</p>

<p>Pre-ICO - stage before ICO (main stage), fundraising for the project. Pre-ICO is conducted to test and verify the demand for the project, get support from the community and expand the budget for marketing before the main ICO. Not all projects carry out pre-ICO.</p>

We are well aware that this fight won&#39;t be easy and if we didn&rsquo;t have the resources, it would hardly be possible. However, the popularity of ICO gives us the opportunity to raise enough funds to compete for the market and take the lead on it. Therefore, we organize the crowdsales, at the expense of which not only we will collect the necessary money, but also attract the attention of the press and create our community, which will support this confrontation.</p>

<p>The distribution of funds received by the platform during the pre-ICO and ICO campaigns will almost completely be used for further development of the platform. The development plan for KICKICO includes not only the further development of the platform itself, but also the marketing of campaigns launched on the platform and the creation of the crowdfunding 2.0 economy, which will replace the outdated model on which modern crowdfunding platforms are working.</p>

<p>The preliminary distribution of funds is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>8% is allocated to the company&#39;s activities, hiring new employees and associated development costs;</li>
	<li>10% payment for PR services, carried out on pre-ICO, ICO and stages releasing;</li>
	<li>7% return on investment invested by investors in the company at the seed stage</li>

<p>Hidden cap is the limit that the authors of ICO campaigns set, but which is not registered in a smart contract and, therefore, is not known to campaign participants.

<p>There are two options for earning a KC: fast and long. A quick option is a variant of ICO-players who buy cryptocurrency at the lowest price and, if possible, sell it with the maximum benefit. Once the cryptocurrency starts trading on the exchange, they sell it, with the possibility of multiplying their funds several times. There is a long option when the buyer of KickCoins is in no hurry and is investing for a long time, but for a much greater benefit. We believe that a &quot;quick option&quot; will yield from x2 to x5. The long version will depend on how many projects will join the KICKONOMY ecosystem, the participants of which will accept KickCoins for payment.</p>

<p class="norm">Crowdfunding</p>

<p>This is the usual crowdfunding campaign, the authors of which create a description and promise rewards for support. The authors pay the platform a 4% commission from fundraising. In contrast to other platforms, bakers of fundraising campaigns get a cashback of 8% in KickCoins from the platform. Moreover, the most interesting campaigns received the status &quot;featured&quot; , receive an increased generation of KickCoins, 20% instead of 8%. Thus, backers receive an additional incentive to participate in these campaigns, and the authors are encouraged to create better and more developed campaigns.</p>

<p class="norm">pre-ICO and ICO</p>

<p>ICO = Initial Coin Offering. These campaigns necessarily have their own cryptocurrency (token), which are received by those who supported them financially, in addition to the KickCoins, which reward the participants of the campaigns platform. Commission platform for the launch of ICO or pre-ICO on the platform - 4% of fees and 4% in the campaign tokens. 8% of KickCoins are generated for the commission received and only for the successful completion of the campaign (thus, KickCoins are secured not only by the success of the campaign and the author&#39;s&#39; work, but also by real money and tokens of this campaign - in fact, by 4% + 4%, KICKICO sells its currency, KickCoins). These 8% are distributed among the participants in the ICO campaign in accordance with their payments.</p>

<p class="norm">Crowdinvesting</p>

<p>Unlike ICO, the tokens of the crowdinvesting campaign are limited to a predetermined number and can not exceed 100%. 100% of tokens = represent 100% of the company. The author himself decides what percentage of the company he wants to sell (for example, 40%) and for how much. Later, 40% will be distributed among those who bought these tokens,when making a profit, in accordance with their shares. Members of crowdinvesting campaigns also receive KickCoins.</p>

However, due to the fact that we are doing everything legally and safely for all participants of the platform, the reception of fiat money won&rsquo;t be realized immediately, but only after an optimal legal scheme has been worked out.</p>

<p>In order to buy the ethereum, you must first create a wallet. The most common way is <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/" target="_blank">www.myetherwallet.com</a> and we recommend using this method of creating and managing your wallet.</p>

IMPORTANT: think up a password that you will not forget - it will be impossible to restore it! Write it down and keep it in a safe place. If it is a question of large sums, instructions on access can be stored in a banking cell.</li>
	<li>In the next step, you will need to keep your secret key encrypted. This is the same as the key to the safe, but in electronic form. Its presence + password is one of the ways to gain access to your wallet and funds, which are on blockchain. Click &quot;Download Keystore File&quot; and save it on your device. Keep this file in a safe place, preferably on an offline medium, and make a backup copy;</li>
	<li>Click &rdquo;I Understand. Continue&rdquo;;</li>
	<li>At this stage you will be given your private key in an unencrypted form. This means that having it, any attacker can get access to your wallet. Therefore, it is recommended to print this key and store it in a safe place (for example, a banking cell). Then click &quot;Save Your Address&quot;;</li>
	<li>The final step is to find out your wallet address. For this you can:
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Select the option &quot;Keystore File (UTC / JSON)&quot;, specify the path to the encrypted file (from step 2) and enter the password invented in step 1. If everything is correct, you will be on the screen of your wallet, you will see its address and balance.</li>
		<li>Select Private Key. Here you will have to enter your unencrypted private address and password will not be required. This is a dangerous and unprotected way, the use of which we do not recommend! This key must be stored in a secure offline store and used only as a last resort.</li>

</div>

<div aria-labelledby="heading7-2" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse7-2" role="tabpanel">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>There are two ways. One simple, the second more complicated. Depending on what exactly you need in the project, you can choose one of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>You create a smart-contract that accepts KickCoins. Each time, when taking KickCoin from a specific wallet address, the smart-contract sends this address to your project (game, store, etc.). Next, it checks who owns this address and receives the goods purchased by him for KickCoin (game currency, product copy, T-shirt, etc.). Simultaneously, a smart-contract sends KickCoin to your company&#39;s wallet.</li>
	<li>This method is more complex and suits you if you want to not just take KickCoin and sell products for them, but want to make a KickCoin turn in your project. For example, if this is a game, then your players can create a real economy in it, buy and sell goods for KickCoin and thus earn real money in the game. In order to realize this, you can create unique KickCoin wallets for your players, which players can replenish and then use their usual accounts within your project. Alternatively, if you need total control over the accounts of your users, then you accept KickCoin for a smart-contract, and users within the project receive a copy of the cryptocurrency. In this case, you can define all actions performed by your users. The downside of this implementation is that users will have to transfer KickCoins to their personal wallet outside of your product,to use their KickCoin somewhere else.</li>

<p>The question isn&rsquo;t quite right, since the SEC decision about &quot;The DAO&quot; from 25/07/17 and the clarification of MAS on the issue of ICO regulation from 01/08/17 don&rsquo;t qualify all ICOs as a valuable papers.</p>

<p>Both documents explain that a token can be qualified as a valuable paper if the issue and sale of crypto tokens occurs in exchange for promises of a share in the company and/or the receipt of dividends and/or other such obligation.</p>

<p>According to the explanations of MAS from 01/08/17 &quot;The types of digital tokens offered in Singapore and other countries vary widely. Some offers of tokens may fall under the regulation of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), while others may not fall. &quot;</p>

<p>These clarifications by the SEC and MAS don&rsquo;t affect the development strategy of our crowdfunding project, as we initially assumed that the release and sale of crypto tokens in exchange for promises of a share in the company or dividends in many countries falls under the regulation of securities legislation and will have to be registered by the relevant way.
