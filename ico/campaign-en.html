            KICKICO — Сrowdfunding 2.0
        </h1>

        <p>
            KICKICO is the first up-and-running blockchain fundraising platform that offers comprehensive solutions for ICOs, crowdfunding, and crowdinvesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We replace the traditional crowdfunding platforms and their porblems: paperwork, high commission rates, and geographical limitations on participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to help innovators, game developers, entrepreneurs, designers, and other future-thinking creators to bring their ideas into reality regardless of their location, origin, and economic status.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are already working in operational mode. We have more than 300 campaigns as drafts and receive around 15 new projects daily — from all over the world and from different industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are running our ICO on our own platform since it's already up-and-running.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use the success and promotion of our own ICO to advise our user's campaigns in the future.

                Already up and running, KICKICO is a crowdfunding, and ICO platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a very favorable start in a very good space. The prospects for KICKICO are better than most of their competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several of their advisers are personally known to me, and the KICKICO link to the <a href="/campaigns/999/ico/team">adviser of RUCHIP</a> is a very good thing indeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very good prospects from an already functioning firm, with excellent management, solid vision, and great execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                A very good sign that the KICKICO team is reaching out to people in the western nations, and points towards the larger vision of Danilevski and the KICKICO team.

            KickCoin. A solid currency, not just a token

        <p>
            KickCoin is a virtual currency that will be accepted and used by the projects that are launched on our platform (as well as by all our partners) and later accepted as a payment method too. KC will be primarely used as a payment method on our platform.

            We expect the following growth rate for KickCoin
        </p>
        <p> 
        Since KICKICO takes half the commission of ICO campaigns in their tokens, the positive growth of these cryptocurrencies affects the entire portfolio of the platform and, thus, indirectly supports the value of KC.
        </p>
        <p class="imginside text-center">
            <img src="/images/campaign/chart1.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to that, the value of KickCoin tokens will also be supported by creation of a token fund: KICKICO takes 4% of the tokens or cryptocurrency produced by an ICO campaign and deposits it in the fund. This fund of campaign tokens will back the value of KC tokens, as projects launched through KICKICO grow in value.

            KickCoin activates Bancor protocol and, being a "Smart token", will have reserves that makes it liquid within Bancor network. 
        </p>
        <p>
            KickCoin will also be a Network token for all projects raising funds on KICKICO platform. This means that KickCoin's value will be supported by all KICKICO projects' tokens, that make reserves within Bancor Network. This will create an arbitrage opportunity to bring KickCoin's value higher on the exchanges

            During the first two years after the ICO we will make a limited bonus emission to reward our community members who hold KickCoins. The bonuses will be credited on the last day of every month. Everyone who holds KC will get added KC automatically at the last day of each month. Bonus emission will be active during 2 years. Each month the percent is different: 3%, 2%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5% etc.
