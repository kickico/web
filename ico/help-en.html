<p class="guide-head">Send your Bitcoins to an exchange</p>

<p>You may choose from variety of exchanges to send your Bitcoins to.</p>

<p>This step is needed to exchange your Bitcoins to Ethereum, so that you will be able to send Ethereum to your private wallet and then to KICKICO crowdsale.</p>

<p>In this very guide we chose EXMO as a service to exchange Bitcoins to Ethereum allowing withdrawal up to 500 ETH with no ID verification. But all other Exchanges actually do the same thing - you transfer them Bitcoins and exchange to Ethereum.</p>

<p>1. Go to <a href="https://exmo.me/" target="_blank">https://exmo.me</a> and sign up (check your email for activation link).</p>

<p>* In case you can&rsquo;t access Exmo exchange - you can download <a href="https://www.exodus.io/releases/" target="_blank">Exodus.io</a> wallet and send your Bitcoins to Exodus wallet and exchange them into Ethereum (but it may be longer and the rate might be higher). Exodus is a great wallet to store your crypto-assets. Just <a href="https://www.exodus.io/releases/" target="_blank">download</a> and install it - and you can use it. Go to Wallet and select Bitcoin - then click Receive button and you will see your Exodus Bitcoin address. Send your Bitcoins to this address. After you received your Bitcoins - go to exchange tab and exchange Bitcoins to Ethereum. The exchange process may take up to 1 hour or more. After you received Ethereum - you can send it from your wallet: go to Wallet, and select Ethereum, then click Send button, insert address and amount and click send.</p>

<p>* Another alternative to an exchange is <a href="https://changelly.com" target="_blank">Changelly service</a>. This service allows you to buy Ethereum directly using your bank card. The interface is really intuitive, BUT LOOK FOR THE RATE. The rate is often really high, so use it in carefully. It may even ask for ID verification process and so on.</p>

<p>2. On <a href="https://exmo.me/" target="_blank">Exmo.me</a> choose a Wallet section in the top menu. Then press &laquo;Deposit&raquo; for BTC.</p>

<p class="imginside text-center"><img src="/images/campaign/guide/guide9.png" /></p>

<p>6. Wait for the network to process your payment and your balance will be added to the stock exchange. Transfer of funds to the balance of Exmo.me pass through 6 network confirmations (6 confirmations). Check the progress of the transaction on the link that the bot offers you.</p>
