                <p dir="ltr">Welcome to KICKICO! This Terms of Use (together with our Privacy Policy [add link to the Privacy Policy], incorporated herein by reference, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is a legal agreement between you and KICKICO (&ldquo;KICKICO&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;). By accessing our website KICKICO.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), you agree to comply with and be legally bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree, please do not access our Site. Our Site is not for minors (persons under 21 &nbsp;or under the legal age in &nbsp;your jurisdiction). If you are minor, then please do not use the Site.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">What We Do</p>

                <p dir="ltr">KICKICO is an online blockchain technology-based crowdfunding platform. We provide online fundraising tools carried out with the help of blockchain technology and smart contracts to individuals and entities that wish to raise cryptocurrencies for causes and projects they care about (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Each person or entity that creates a project (a &ldquo;Project Creator&rdquo;) can set up a project page where they can post stories, photos, audio clips, testimonials, and videos about their projects and receive cryptocurrency transfers from those who support the project (the &ldquo;Backers,&rdquo; and together with Project Creators and visitors to the Site, &ldquo;Users&rdquo;). Through our advanced search tools, all visitors to the Site can search through all of the projects and choose to provide their cryptocurrencies to the ones that they wish to support. Even though anyone can become a Backer by contributing cryptocurrency towards any project, only Backers can become Project Creators and create their own campaigns on the Site.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">KICKICO only provides a technology platform that allows Project Creators to connect with Backers. By providing cryptocurrency to a project, Backers enter into contracts directly with Project Creators. KICKICO is not a party to those agreements. All dealings are solely between Users. We make no representations about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any project or the truth or accuracy of any User Content that appears on the Site. We do not guarantee that provided cryptocurrency will be used as promised or that the projects will reach their goals. Those who access or use the Service do so at their own risk and volition and are solely responsible for compliance with applicable law.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ownership</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Owning KickCoin tokens does not in any way grant their holder any ownership or right to property in KickCoins or on the KICKICO platform or that of any other related company. While the community&rsquo;s opinions and feedback may be taken into account, KickCoin tokens do not give any right to participate in decision making or any direction of business development related to the KICKICO platform.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Absence of guarantees of income or profit</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There is no guarantee that KickCoin tokens will grow in value. If it happens, there are no guarantees that the rate of KickCoins will not decrease, including significantly, due to some unforeseen events, or events over which the developers have no control, or because of force majeure circumstances.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Risks associated with Ethereum</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Some KickCoin tokens can be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, any failure or malfunctioning of the Ethereum protocol may lead to the trading network of KickCoin tokens working unexpectedly.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Regulatory uncertainty</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Blockchain technologies are subject to supervision and control by various regulatory bodies around the world. KickCoin tokens may fall under one or more requests or actions on their part, including but not limited to restrictions imposed on the use or possession of digital tokens such as KickCoins, which may slow or limit the functionality or repurchase of KickCoin tokens in the future.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">By sending cryptocurrency to purchase KickCoin tokens from us, you represent and warrant that:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li dir="ltr">
                        <p dir="ltr">Your purchase of KickCoin tokens complies with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, including, but not limited to,</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p dir="ltr">(i) legal capacity and any other threshold requirements in your jurisdiction for the purchase of the KickCoin tokens and entering into contracts with the KICKICO,</p>

                <p dir="ltr">(ii) any foreign exchange or regulatory restrictions applicable to such purchase, and</p>

                <p dir="ltr">(iii) any governmental or other consents that may need to be obtained;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">(b) You will comply with any applicable tax obligations in your jurisdiction arising from your purchase of KickCoin tokens; and</p>

                <p dir="ltr">(c) You are not a citizen or resident of a geographic area in which acceptance of delivery of the KickCoin tokens is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The regulatory status of the KickCoin tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or</p>

                <p dir="ltr">unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the KickCoin tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or</p>

                <p dir="ltr">regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including KickCoin tokens. Regulatory actions</p>

                <p dir="ltr">could negatively impact the KickCoin tokens in various ways, including, for purposes</p>

                <p dir="ltr">of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of the KickCoin tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that the KickCoin tokens are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. KICKICO may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">KickCoin tokens are not an investment</p>

                <p dir="ltr">KickCoin tokens are not official or legally binding investments of any kind. KickCoin digital tokens are designed to be used inside KIСKIСO to pay for the launch of crowdfunding projects, to purchase various attributes for crowdfunding projects, and for other internal processes and payments within the infrastructure of the KICKICO and KICKONOMY. In case of unforeseen circumstances, the objectives stated in this document may be changed. Despite the fact that we intend to reach all goals described in this document, all persons and parties involved in the purchase of KickCoin tokens do so at their own risk.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Quantum computers</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Technical innovations, like the development of quantum computers, may pose a danger to cryptocurrencies, including KickCoin tokens.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Risk of losing funds</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Funds collected in fundraising are in no way insured. If they are lost or lose their value, there is no private or public insurance representative that buyers can reach out to.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Returning funds</p>

                <p dir="ltr">If a campaign does not end successfully, is canceled by its Project creator or moderators, the funds are returned to the wallets of those users who transferred funds to the wallet of the smart campaign. Fees charged by KICKICO are non-refundable even if a campaign does not end successfully.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Risks of using new technologies</p>

                <p dir="ltr">KickCoin tokens are a new and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks mentioned in this document, there are certain additional risks that the team of the KICKICO platform cannot foresee. These risks may manifest themselves in other forms of risk than those specified herein.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Crowdinvesting</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The KICKICO platform disclaims any and all responsibility or liability in relation to any obligations made by Project creator of crowdinvesting campaigns to Backers who bought their digital tokens on the KICKICO platform. The KICKICO is not a part of a contract between Project creator of crowdinvesting campaigns and their Backers.. The function of the KICKICO platform is only to provide online software fundraising tools to individuals and entities that wish to raise cryptocurrencies for causes and projects they care about. The Project creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project.</p>
